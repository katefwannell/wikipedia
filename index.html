              <p>The <a href="index.html">Alpine Chough</a> (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is a bird in the crow family, one of only two species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. Its two subspecies breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss. This bird has glossy black plumage, a yellow beak, red legs, and distinctive calls. It has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely spread flight feathers. The Alpine chough pairs for life and displays fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a lined stick nest and lays three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.</p>

              <p>Red Hand Day or International Day against the Use of Child Soldiers,[1] February 12 each year, is an annual commemoration day on which pleas are made to political leaders and events are staged around the world to draw attention to the fates of child soldiers, children who are forced to serve as soldiers in wars and armed conflicts. The aim of Red Hand Day is to call for action against this practice, and support for children who are affected by it. Children have been used repeatedly as soldiers in recent years including armed conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Sudan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Myanmar, Philippines, Colombia, and Palestine.[2] Estimates on the number of children engaging in armed conflict around the world showed no change between 2006 and 2009.[3][4] Rehabilitation for child-soldiers returned to their communities ranges from inadequate to non-existent.</p>

              <p>Growing up in Chicago, Ghez first wanted to be a ballerina. The moon landings inspired her to want to become the first female astronaut and her mother supported her goal. Her most influential female role model was her high school chemistry teacher.[3] She started out in college by majoring in mathematics but changed to physics.[4] She received a BS in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1987 and her Ph.D. under the direction of Prof. Gerry Neugebauer at the California Institute of Technology in 1992.</p>
